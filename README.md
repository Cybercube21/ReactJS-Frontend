In this repo i provide the code hosted on [memes.cybercube21.de](https://memes.cybercube21.de). 
A Meme website written in ReactJS which uses [my API](https://api.cybercube21.de) as a backend. It fetches a random meme from my API and embed it.

Right now, it detects .webp's as pictures and embed it in a "<img>" tag, while .webm's are detected as videos and getting embed in a "<video>" tag.\
I might rework that later, but dont count on it.
