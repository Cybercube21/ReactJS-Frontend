# ReactJS Frontend


In this repo i provide the code ~~hosted on [memes.cybercube21.de](https://memes.cybercube21.de). <br>~~ This will be replaced by a frontend written in Nuxt soon.

A website written in ReactJS which uses [my API](https://api.cybercube21.de) as a backend. It fetches a random meme from my API and embed it. 

It can be used to embed any image or video as long as it got the right file extension tho

Right now, it detects .webp's as pictures and embed it in a \<img> tag, while .webm's are detected as videos and getting embed in a \<video> tag.\

## Installation

Clone the repo and use npm to install the dependencies:

```shell
clone git@github.com:Cybercube21/ReactJS-Frontend.git
cd reactjs-frontend/
npm install .
```

To start a dev-build use:
```shell
npm start
```

This should be enough to get started.
